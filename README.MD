# Overview
This application was done for the [mongodb hackathon](https://www.digitalocean.com/mongodb-hackathon/) through [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). This is an initial proof of concept CRUD application around tracking Super Smash Bros. Ultimate 1v1 Stock matches. The application allows for users to be created, and matches to be created, viewed, updated, and deleted for those users.

## Technologies and Learning
The MongoDB and React application are hosted on DigitalOcean. This was the first time connecting MongoDB to React, in addition to using MongoDB and Droplots hosted on DigitalOcean.
